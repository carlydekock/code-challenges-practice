//389. Find The Difference
//You are given two strings s and t.
//String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.
//Return the letter that was added to t.

  const countOfS = {};
  const countOfT = {};

  for(let i = 0; i < s.length; i++){
    const currentChar = s.charAt(i);
    countOfS[currentChar] ? countOfS[currentChar]++ : countOfS[currentChar] = 1;

  for(let i = 0; i < t.length; i++){
    const currentChar = t.charAt(i);

//Summary: Since we know there is one additional letter in t that is not in s, we need to track a count of the letters in both t and s, then compare to find which is the added letter.
//Pattern: Count/map for letters in each string, iterate through the keys and compare them to see which is different. Two maps/objects for count, then iterate through keys in a for loop.
